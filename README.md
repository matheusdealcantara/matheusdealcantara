### Hi there, I'm Matheus de AlcÃ¢ntaraðŸ‘‹

##### I'm a backend developer, focused on python with django but studying javascript with nodejs and typescript, as well as java and spring. Currently taking a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Universidade de BrasÃ­lia - UnB. I tend to look for more knowledge all the time and try my best at everything I do, which makes me a bit stubborn and competitive, but I can adapt and work with any team that I join! 

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on a todo list application
  
- ðŸŒ± Learning about web development, back-end heavy
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on all sort of projects to acquire new knowledge
